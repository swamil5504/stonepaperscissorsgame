# stonepaperscissorsgame
This is a simple Python program that allows you to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game randomly selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for the computer, and you choose your move. The program then determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

#How To Play 

Run the Python script in your terminal or Python environment.
The computer will randomly select Rock (r), Paper (p), or Scissors (s).
You will be prompted to enter your choice by typing 'r' for Rock, 'p' for Paper, or 's' for Scissors.
The program will compare your choice with the computer's choice and declare the result.

#Rules
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both you and the computer choose the same option, the game is a tie.
